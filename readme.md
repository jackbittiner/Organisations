# Financial Times Tech Test

## The Task

An organisation has the following properties:

- Name
- Year founded
- Revenue

Please use Node.js and a database of your choice to create a CRUD API - a set of HTTP endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting organisations.

The rest is entirely up to you. :)

## How to Run

#### Install the App

Make sure you have node installed. (I'm using version 10.15.2)
Make sure you have NPM installed. (I'm using version 6.4.1)

```
// clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:jackbittiner/FT-Tech-Test.git
// enter the repository
cd Ft-Tech-Test
// install the dependencies
npm i
```

#### The Tests

```
// start the test server
npm run test-server
// open a terminal tab
npm test
```

You should see the following:

All Green! Nice! (...hopefully)

#### Run the App

```
// make sure you've stopped running the test server
// enter the client
cd client
// install dependencies
npm i
// run the app
npm start
```
